# Stratego

Implemenation of the classic boardgame Stratego, written in Java.

## Motivation

In my first semesters in college we learned a lot about modeling techniques and OOP. We learned to model board game instructions through many different UML diagrams. 

On our own initiative, a fellow student and I decided to develop the UML diagram modeled board game "Stratego" with Java as a playable computer game.
